# Annotate Bounding Boxes

Given a path to a directory that is associated with a particular class of objects or images, loop through all images in that directory and allow the user to interactively draw rectangles around one object per image. These will be the bounding boxes of an object of a particular class within that image. The bounding boxes are dumped to a pickle file in a local cache directory once iteration is complete.
